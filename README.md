Hirsch Index and Grade Distributions for Clemson University Professors
````

## Overview
Professor Search provides in-depth information about professors and courses at Clemson University, including grade distributions and research statistics. This data
is sourced from [Clemson's Grade Distribution Reports](https://www.clemson.edu/institutional-effectiveness/oir/GDR.html) and [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri). The site was built using the Angular web framework, with visualizations in d3.js.
